  "summary": "Diff adds a new Motoko backend actor with product catalog CRUD (admin-only) and Stripe session operations, plus a new React storefront with routing, cart, Stripe success/cancel pages, and an admin UI (products + Stripe setup). Some required backend API/role-bootstrap pieces are not evidenced in the diff, and a few extra features were added that were not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes query methods to list products and fetch a product by id.",
